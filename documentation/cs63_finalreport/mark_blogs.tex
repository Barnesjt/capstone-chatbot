     \\\hline
     Fall - Week 4 &
     \textbf{Progress:}
     This week we have finished writing our Problem Statement and started working on the second draft of our Requirements paper. 
     We have talked with our client to know what she expected from this project and laying the ground works of what components are needed for it.
     \\ & \textbf{Problems:}
     There isn't much going on this week for my group as our client is very accommodating and flexible so there aren't too much progress or problems this week.
     \\ & \textbf{Plans:}
     Next week we are planning to talk to our client again to discuss about each group member's task on the project. 
     \\
     \hline
     Fall - Week 5 &
     \textbf{Progress:}
     This week we have talked to our client about the tech review paper and how we will split up our roles. 
     I will be responsible for the "Deployment" part of the project, which is something I'm quite unfamiliar with so I do need to do some research on it.
     \\ & \textbf{Problems:}
     Not a problem per say, but as I am not familiar with the deploying software projects before, I do need to do some research on it for a better understanding.
     \\ & \textbf{Plans:}
     Next week I will be revising the tech review paper for its final submission.
     \\
     \hline
     Fall - Week 6 &
     \textbf{Progress:}
     Other than finishing our Tech Review, there isn't much going on in my group this week. 
     I have done a bit more research on deployment and played around with some tools.
     \\ & \textbf{Problems:}
     I do have some personal troubles with keeping things on track as almost everything in my schedule got crammed into this one week. 
     But I somehow managed to get through it without too much trouble in the end.
     \\ & \textbf{Plans:}
     Next week my group is planning to talk to our client again to discuss about they want in the design document.
     \\
     \hline
     Fall - Week 7 &
     \textbf{Progress:}
     This week we have talked with our client about what technology we reviewed and recommended in our Tech Review before discussing about the Design document and some future plans. 
     \\ & \textbf{Problems:}
     Other than the ongoing research to understand the project and its deployment, there's no real problems this week.
     \\ & \textbf{Plans:}
     We will be working on our design document over the weekend and until the due date. 
     I will also take a closer look at the tools require for the project whenever I'm free.
     \\
     \hline
     Fall - Week 8 &
     \textbf{Progress:} This week we finished working on our design document. 
     \\ & \textbf{Problems:}
     Other than some further research, there isn't much going on this week since this week is pretty slow.
     \\ & \textbf{Plans:}
     Next week we are planning to talk to our client some more for updates and clarity.
     \\
     \hline
     Fall - Week 9 &
     \textbf{Progress:}
     There are two major things we have done this week: finishing up the Design Document and compiling everything we wrote so far for our client to review. We didn't finish the design document before we met our client again but we did show her what we got so far for it.
     \\ & \textbf{Problems:}
     There isn't much else that went on this week besides finishing the design document.
     \\ & \textbf{Plans:}
     We will meet our client again for one last time for this term and we will also discuss on what to do in preparation for the implementation phase of this project.
     \\
     \hline
     Winter - Week 1 &
     \textbf{Progress:}
     I have talked with one of my group members about how we will plan out our progress for the next few weeks and how we will start setting up and create our chatbot. 
     So far I have done some trail-and-error with the code infrastructure and Jenkins (continuous integration) on a virtual machine to some degree of success. 
     \\ & \textbf{Problems:}
     My current problem right now is recovering from jetlag as soon as possible so I can meet with the rest of my team on time.
     \\ & \textbf{Plans:}
     Next week we are making plans to meet up again to discuss our project.
     \\
     \hline
     Winter - Week 2 &
     \textbf{Progress:}
     We met with each other this week to discuss on how to setup our online workspace.
     \\ & \textbf{Problems:}
     No real problems this week.
     \\ & \textbf{Plans:}
     This weekend we will discuss on what we found and finally able to start working on our project.
     \\
     \hline
     Winter - Week 3 &
     \textbf{Progress:}
     This week we have finished setting up our Virtual Machine environment for our workspace and can now start working. 
     We still need to figure out how to make the chatbot work with the relay properly but that's for later. 
     \\ & \textbf{Problems:}
     We still need to figure out how to make the chatbot work with the relay properly but that's for later.
     \\ & \textbf{Plans:}
     Tomorrow we will be trying out more of the backend and deployment tools that will be needed for the chatbot.
     \\
     \hline
     Winter - Week 4 &
     This week's blog entry appears to be missing from Canvas.\\
     \hline
     Winter - Week 5 &
     \textbf{Progress:}
     On Friday, me and Jack have started to code on connecting the chatbot to the relay.
     \\ & \textbf{Problems:}
     I'm unfamiliar with Node.js as I've never written code in this language up to this point but I have coded in Javascript before. 
     There is also trying to work with the myriad amount of tools and APIs that will be used in this project.
     \\ & \textbf{Plans:}
     We will meet again on Saturday to talk about the poster draft and coding for the project.\\
     \hline
     Winter - Week 6 &
     \textbf{Progress:}
     This week we figured out our schedule for our design review which is on Tuesday of Week 9. 
     Besides that I've worked a bit on the project in getting the chatbot to communicate with the relay to some extent. 
     This is done by adding new available commands that the chatbot can reply to.
     \\ & \textbf{Problems:}
     It's been a busy week for me so there isn't as much progress as I want to.
     \\ & \textbf{Plans:}
     Next week we'll discuss and work more on the project, particularly on the relay and authentication. 
     \\
     \hline
     Winter - Week 7 &
     \textbf{Progress:}
     Pretty much the same routine this week, working on our project. 
     To be more precise, we are currently working on attaching the relay to the netscaler API so they can communicate with each other. 
     Besides that we are writing more commands to our chatbot so it can interpret more user commands.
     \\ & \textbf{Problems:}
     No real problems this week.
     \\ & \textbf{Plans:}
     We are planning to meet again this Sunday to discuss on our progress.
     \\
     \hline
     Winter - Week 8 &
     \textbf{Progress:}
     This week we are finishing up any remaining key features for our Alpha, creating the presentation, and editing the materials needed for our review.
     \\ & \textbf{Problems:}
     While trying to finish up the alpha, we faced some problems in getting the chatbot to deploy on the cloud and automatically and writing appropriate tests for it. 
     \\ & \textbf{Plans:}
     Next week we will be deciding speaker roles for our Design Review on Tuesday and start finishing up our Beta.
     \\
     \hline
     Winter - Week 9 &
     \textbf{Progress:}
     We did our design review this week and got some good feedback on it. 
     Our client also saw our design review and she said it is going in the right direction.
     \\ & \textbf{Problems:}
     No real problems this week, besides being closer to finals.
     \\ & \textbf{Plans:}
     We're planning to meet on this Sunday to discuss on what to improve for our beta.
     \\
     \hline
     Winter - Week 10 &
     \textbf{Progress:}
     For this week we are pretty much working on getting our Beta finished so we can demonstrate it in a video and writing the final term progress report. 
     I have also made preparations for recording our Beta video for next week as well.
     \\ & \textbf{Problems:}
     Other than some finishing touches for the beta, no real problems this week.
     \\ & \textbf{Plans:}
     We are planning to take said video on Monday and after that we will likely contact our client over the Spring break to discuss on what to do next.
